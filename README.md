**HM-Nmap** is a Python-based tool for Linux that enables stealthy communication between two parties by encoding messages into open TCP ports. The **encoder** script converts a plaintext message into a series of open ports, while the **decoder** scans these ports using **nmap** to reconstruct the original message. This technique leverages port scanning capabilities and is particularly useful in scenarios where traditional communication channels are monitored or restricted.

üçÄ **NOTE:** This is an ongoing **research project** for educational purposes rather than a full-fledged production-ready tool, so treat it accordingly.

## üéØ Advantages

- **Easy to Use**: Host 1 (the **Encoder**) encodes a covert message by opening certain ports.
- **Stealthy**: Host 2 (the **Decoder**) utilizes **nmap** port scanning to decode the hidden message.
- **No Additional Dependencies**: Relies on standard Python libraries and `nmap`, which is freely available.
- **Secure**: Needs a pre-shared password (token) and only allows communication with the intended host. 
- **Messaging**: Supports messages up to 100 characters. Limit may increase in future versions.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Encoder (Host Writing the Message)

1. **Message Input**: The user inputs a plaintext message (up to 100 characters).
2. **Port Encoding**:
   - Each character in the message is converted to its ASCII value.
   - A unique port number is calculated using the formula:
     ```
     port = base_port + (position_in_message * 256) + ASCII_value
     ```
   - This ensures that even repeated characters map to different ports based on their position.
3. **Opening Ports**:
   - The encoder asynchronously opens the calculated ports on the host machine.
   - The user can manually check if ports have been opened using `netstat -nlpt`.
   - A control server listens on a predefined port for shutdown signals from the other host.
4. **Ready Signal**:
   - After opening all ports, the encoder sends a "ready" signal to the decoder, indicating that the message is ready to be read.

### Decoder (Host Reading the Message)

1. **Listening for Ready Signal**:
   - The decoder listens on a specific port for the "ready" signal from the encoder.
   - Upon receiving the signal and validating the shared secret token, it proceeds to scan ports on the encoder using **nmap**.
2. **Port Scanning**:
   - Scans the encoder's IP address over the calculated port range.
   - Collects all open ports and sorts them.
3. **Message Decoding**:
   - Reconstructs the original message by:
     - Calculating the position and ASCII value from each port number.
     - Sorting characters based on their position.
     - Concatenating characters to form the message.
4. **Shutdown Signal**:
   - Optionally sends a shutdown signal back to the encoder to trigger cleanup.

### Cleanup Process

- **Trigger**: Initiated when the decoder sends a shutdown signal after successfully decoding the message.
- **Function**:
  - The encoder receives the signal and gracefully closes all opened ports.
  - Stops the control server and terminates the encoder script.
- **Purpose**:
  - Ensures that no unnecessary ports remain open, maintaining system security.
  - Confirms to the encoder that the message was successfully received and decoded.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `python-nmap` and `nmap` installed on the decoder machine

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository (on both hosts)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pdudotdev/hm-nmap.git
cd hm-nmap/hm-nmap
```

2. **Install Python-Nmap (on the Decoder host only)**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo pip install python-nmap
```

3. **Install Nmap (on the Decoder host only)**
```bash
sudo apt install nmap
```

## üìù Usage

- **Important**: Make sure the **decoder** is running and listening *before* executing the **encoder** script on the other host.
- **Testing**: **HM-Nmap** has been (and is) currently tested only with **Kali Linux**. Other distros such as **Ubuntu** should be fine, too.

### Encoder Setup
1. **Run the Encoder Script**
```bash
sudo python3 encoder.py <decoder_ip> <shared_token>
```
- `<decoder_ip>`: IP address of the decoder machine.
- `<shared_token>`: Pre-shared secret token for authentication.

2. **Input Message**
- Enter your message when prompted (max 100 characters).
```
[INPUT] Enter the message to encode (max 100 characters):
```

3. **Encoder Output**
- The encoder opens the calculated ports and sends a ready signal.
- Example output:
```
[INFO] Attempting to open ports.
[INFO] Control server is listening on port 9000
[INFO] Ready signal sent to the decoder.
```

4. **Optional: Disable Firewall**
```bash
sudo ufw disable
```

### Decoder Setup
1. **Run the Decoder Script**
```bash
sudo python3 decoder.py <encoder_ip> <shared_token>
```
- `<encoder_ip>`: IP address of the encoder machine.
- `<shared_token>`: Pre-shared secret token for authentication.

2. **Decoder Output**
- The decoder listens for the ready signal, scans ports, and decodes the message.
- Example output:
```
[INFO] Listening for 'ready' signal on port 9001...
[INFO] Received valid 'ready' signal from the encoder.
[INFO] Scanning <encoder_ip> for open ports in range 10000-65535...
[MESSAGE DECODED] Encoder says: Your secret message here
[INPUT] Do you want to confirm receipt to the encoder? y is recommended (y/n):
```

3. **Confirm Receipt**
- Enter `y` to send a shutdown signal, triggering the encoder's cleanup process.

4. **Optional: Disable Firewall**
```bash
sudo ufw disable
```

## ‚õëÔ∏è Security Considerations
- **Administrative Privileges**: **HM-Nmap** requires **sudo** privileges, so ensure that only trusted users have access to the scripts.
- **Network Impact**: Manipulating open ports can have unintended consequences on network operations. Use **HM-Nmap** in controlled environments.
- **Pre-shared Token**: Be cautious with token sharing. Always share the secret password through a separate secure channel.
- **Closing Ports**: Closing ports may violate organizational policies. Ensure compliance before using **HM-Nmap**.

## üéØ Planned Upgrades
- [x] Improved CLI experience
- [ ] More testing is needed

## üôè Special Thank You
The idea behind creating **HM-Nmap** was inspired by the concept of **Network Dead Drops** pioneered by Tobias Schmidbauer, Steffen Wendzel, Aleksandra Mileva and Wojciech Mazurczyk in **Introducing Dead Drops to Network Steganography using ARP-Caches and SNMP-Walks** (more details [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3339252.3341488)).

Main differences between the original approach and **HM-Nmap**:
- **HM-Nmap** introduces a new flavor of **Network Dead Drops**, named **Passive Self-Hosted Network Dead Drops**.
- **Passive** because no active connection is established. **Self-Hosted** because the encoder stores the hidden message.
- Unlike the original **Network Dead Drops** concept, **HM-Nmap** does not use an unaware 3rd party to store hidden messages.
- Unlike the original **Network Dead Drops** concept, **HM-Nmap** uses a completely different method for storing the message.
- Unlike the original **Network Dead Drops** concept, **HM-Nmap** the receiver (decoder) scans the encoder to get the message.
- **HM-Nmap** does not involve a 3rd party for the dead drop which may raise suspicions or be illegal. Also reduces complexity.
- Other differences in nuances of the overall logic and communication flow, as well as of the actual code implementation.
